When furthering CUD development on Vote, Praxis, and PraxisParticipant (PP)
service classes, you really want to read all of the CUD Praxis / PP docs. This
is because these are extremely intertwined.

Be aware that these two rules in particular are relied upon heavily:
    - A Praxis must have at least one PP.
    - A Player can only have a single Character per Praxis.

Additionally, be mindful of Dueling (`Praxis.AreDueling`).
